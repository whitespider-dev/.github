## About Us
WhiteSpider (also known as WhiteSpider Dev) is a small but ambitious software development organization. We aim to bring everyone online freedom without any charges, as we believe that everyone deserves the freedom of doing whatever they would like to do.  <br />

Our primary project, WhiteSpider, is a FOSS (free open-source software) unblocked games website, which aims to provide every internet user the liberty of playing games or accessing other restricted services in a restricted network environment.  <br />

Although we have not started any other long-term projects since the organization was founded (due to the limitation of financial support), there is a plan for releasing a new project in September 2024. <br />

### History
WhiteSpider was founded by a casual software developer, <a href="https://github.com/ruochenjia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruochen Jia</a> in July 2022, who sacrificed most of his free time on developing the WhiteSpider website. This made it possible to publish the website before September 2022, where most of our users started to use it. <br />

The website was initially published under the domain name `whitespider.gq`, as it was available for free on <a href="https://www.freenom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freenom</a>. It was used as the primary link for the WhiteSpider website until the end of 2023, where Freenom <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/sued-by-meta-freenom-halts-domain-registrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped most of its services</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freenom/comments/1akf1cv/every_domain_is_now_down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many users reported losing their free domains on Freenom</a>. <br />

By the end of 2023, we decided to transfer all of our primary services to our new domain name, `whitespider.dev`, while preserving the old domain names for redirecting old users. <br />

### Background
There are many places in the world where internet censorship controls over the users' freedom, and we believe it is wrong. Therefore by providing a free open-source unblocking service, all restricted users will be able to browse the internet freely. <br />
